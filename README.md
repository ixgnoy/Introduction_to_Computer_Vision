Introduction of Computer Vision by TensorFlow

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>TensorFlow is an open source, powerful, portable machine learning (ML) library developed by Google that can work with very large datasets.

In this lab, you will create and train a computer vision model to recognize different items of clothing using TensorFlow on Google Cloud Compute Engine.</p>

<h2>What I have done:</h2>
- Set up the development environment in the IDE
- Design, compile, train and evaluate your model
- Save and load models
- Write your own callbacks to customize behaviour during training
- Complete a series of exercises to guide you through experimenting with the different layers of the network
